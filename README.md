# IMAGE-STEGANOGRAPHY-WITH-SOCKET-PROGRAMMING
In this proposed system, we deal with least significant method of image steganography that
hides the secret message in the least significant bits of the pixel values without introducing
many perceptible distortions. The changes in the value of least significant bit of the image is
imperceptible in human eye.
Applying LSB strategy to each byte of a 24-cycle picture, three pieces can be encoded into
each pixel, as each pixel is tended to be three bytes. Applying LSB strategy to each byte of a
8-cycle picture, simply a tiny smidgen can be encoded into each pixel, as each pixel is tended
to by one byte. LSB embedding is a clear strategy to execute steganography.
